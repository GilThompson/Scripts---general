#Function readFieldMapsExcel to read the field maps that are done in the BW program in MS Excel. A list of their names is passed.
#Usually it is a small number of fieldmap files corresponding to one section, because they need to have unique column numbers.
#It is oriented to format the field map to input in the script Athena did CSVtoKML in python.
#The files need to have all the same size and start and end row and columns of the data in the first sheet of the Excel file.
#the start and end column and row to read from the Excel are defaulted, but can be changed.
#the trial name is expected to be in the last column of the excel file
